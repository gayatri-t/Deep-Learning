# Deep Learning Homework 2

The codes are based on PyTorch 2.0 and Python 3.6.

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Download the Spoken-SQuAD datasets both test and train in to the root folder.
2. Install necessary packages if not already installed.
3. Run the code using bash command on a terminal.

Ensure that you have the required datasets downloaded and placed in the root folder before running the code. Additionally, make sure to have all necessary packages installed to avoid any compatibility issues.
